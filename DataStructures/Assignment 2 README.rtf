\f0\fs24 \cf0 For the second assignment, I used the ArtistList I had created for assignment 1. I had a single linked list, so I created a method insert first, and added last as a node. So we have pointers for both nodes, first and last in order for a linked list to create a queues. Since queues require a doubly linked list. I made my artists and insertFirst/insertLast methods with one args as well as two. Since in this assignment I didn\'92t need to keep track of the repeats, but the first one I did. The data contains only a list of songs, I used the global and the regional data from Spotify. \
